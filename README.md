# EnglishDictionary

A simple gem that checks if a word is in the English dictionary. I'm using the word list that LetterPress uses [here](https://github.com/atebits/Words).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'english_dictionary'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install english_dictionary

## Usage

Just run the executable:

```
	english_dictionary
```

And it will point you to the article.
